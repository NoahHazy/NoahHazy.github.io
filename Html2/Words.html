			<dd>1 Corinthians 13:4-8 New International Version (NIV): </dd>
	<br />
			<dd>4 Love is patient, love is kind. 
			It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 
			5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, 
			it keeps no record of wrongs. 
			6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 
			7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.</dd>
