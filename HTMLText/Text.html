    <h1>Welcome to my Web page</h1>
    <h3><strong>(Let's learn HTML!)</strong></h3>
    <p>Before we start let me tell you a little about myself. This is the 1<sup>st</sup>
      time that I have taught this course. I was born at a very young age and grew in wisdom and
      grace until now. Of course, I hope to continue to grow in both  wisdo, and grace the will require effort
      and attention to what is happening in the world and in myself. I hope you learn alot about Web
      progamming and are enlightened by what we do in the class. Good Luck!</p>

    <p>When writing web pages you need to make sure that you are attentive to lots of details like
      the structure and formatting of the page. I want to <strong>emphasize</strong> to you the importance of this.</p>
  <hr />
    <p>I want to make sure that you uunderstand what I mean so I would like to quote myself.
      <blockquote>It is very important to be aware of all the small details when writing web pages.
        Afterall, small details can  make a bid difference. Be conscious of what you are learning and why
        you are learning it. We will certainly learn alot in this class but we must always exert effort to learn</blockquote></p>
