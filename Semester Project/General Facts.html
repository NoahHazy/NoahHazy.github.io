        		<figcaption id="White" > <strong> <i> Panthera leo, </i> </strong> the African Lion. The African Lion is
        		an inhabitant of Africa and is one of the only felines to be social. Lions are actually very social in fact, living
        		in groups - known as Prides - of up to 30 others. The prides are usually made up of 1 or 2 males and the rest are females and cubs. The females
        		- known as Lionesses - are the main hunters of the pride. They work in groups to bring down large prey such as buffalo and zebra. The males are the ones who
        		protect the territory from intruding, younger, nomadic lions and hyenas or african wild dogs. Their roar can be heard from 5 miles away and their teeth are super sharp.
        		They also have retractable claws and a swing that hits as hard as a sledgehammer to the skull. That's deadly! </figcaption>
