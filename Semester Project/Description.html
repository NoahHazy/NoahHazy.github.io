        		<figcaption id="White" >Lions have strong, compact bodies and a powerful build. They have incredible foreleg muscles
        		teeth and jaws used for pulling down and killing massive prey. Their coats are yellow-gold, and adult males have shaggy manes that range in color
        		 from blond to reddish-brown to black. The length and color of a lions mane is likely determined by age, genetics and hormones.
        		 Young lions have light spotting on their coats that disappear as they get older. Without coats, lion's and tiger's boides are so similar that it takes
        		 experts to tell them apart. Lions stand between 3.5 and 4 feet (1 and 1.2 meters) tall at the shoulder. Males grow to lengths of 10 feet (3 meters) and have a 2 to 3 foot (60 to 91 centimeter) tail. 
        		 They weigh from 330 to 550 pounds (150 to 250 kilograms). Slightly smaller, females grow to lengths of 9 feet (2.7 meters) and weigh between 265 and 395 pounds.</figcaption>
