    <h1>Obi-Wan Kenobi</h1>
    
    <p><img src="Obi-Wan.jpg" alt="Jedi" title="Hello There" height="400" width="630" align="right"/>Obi-Wan Kenobi
       is a jedi master who serves as a big supporting character in the Star Wars Prequels. He has a cunning, calm, and a negotiative
       nature to himself that allows him to be quite affable and understanding. Serving as also a father and older brother figure to both
       Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amadala. He serves as my second favorite character in the whole series, right behind Darth Maul</p>
